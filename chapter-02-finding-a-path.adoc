= Chapter 2 - Navigating change

IMPORTANT: this was originally called Finding a path: From here on in I use a heavy red pen!

The problem I had was how do I map a business?
Unlike a board game such as chess with its turned based moves, when you consider a business it is a living thing.
It consists of a network of people, a mass of different activities and reserves of capital including financial, physical, human and social.
It consumes, it produces, it grows and it dies.
Like all organisms, any business exists within a community of others, an ecosystem.
It competes and co-operates for resources and it’s shaped by and shapes its environment.
Even within a business, people come and go.
The things we do, the things we build and the things that others desire change over time.
All firms are in a constant state of flux and the ecosystem it lives within never stands still.


It was at this point I thought about representing *what* was core for a business and questioning *how* this changed over time.
My reasoning was simple.
A business, like all organisms, needs to continuously adapt to changes in order to survive.
Take for example, the multinational Finnish company Nokia.
Originally founded in 1865 as a paper mill, the company has undergone many transformations: from a paper mill, to a rubber manufacturer, to consumer electronics, to a telecommunications giant.
As an organism Nokia has radically evolved.
The core interest of Nokia today was not its core interest in 1865.
In 1865 Nokia management would be incapable of imagining the Nokia of the 21st Century.
How could I connect the two?
When you focus on what is core for a company then the question becomes whether you mean core today, core yesterday or core tomorrow?
They are not necessarily the same.

I started to ask *why* do things change?
When talking to my peers responses varied from “progress” to “innovation” to “disruption”.
This included the appearance of random innovations that impact the way we operate — from the telephone, to electricity, to computing.
In any industrial ecosystem, novel and new things constantly appear.
Those things that are useful will be copied.
They will spread: the once novel, becomes commonplace.
The magic of the first electric light bulb, the first computer and the first telephone are now an expected norm.
We also build things on the basis that these common things will continue to exist.
How they are created may change - but that does not directly impact on how we consume them.
Over time many things will become obselete as their functions are replaced by more general things.
This is what has happened to the fax machine and cassette tape.
Somehow, I had to map this competition itself including the journey from novel to commonplace.
But what is that journey and what are the components that I’m going to map?

The more I looked into this, the more complex it became because that journey from novel to commonplace is not the end of the story.
These extremes are connected as one enables the other.
A historical demonstration of this would be Maudslay’s screw cutting lathe in 1800.
The invention of the first screw thread is often cited as 400BC by Archytas of Tarentum (428 BC — 350 BC).
Early versions of this and the subsequent nut and bolt designs were custom made by skilled artisans with each nut fitting one bolt and no other.
The introduction of Maudslay’s lathe enabled repeated production of uniform nuts and bolts with standard threads.
One nut now fitted many bolts and vice versa.
The artisan skill of building the perfect nut and bolt was replaced by more mass produced and interchangeable components.
The novel had become commonplace.
Whilst those artisans might have lamented the loss of their industry, those humble components also enabled the rapid creation of more complex machinery.
Uniform components enabled the faster building of ships, guns and other devices.

Things that are commonplace change social expectations and allow for new forms of practice and organisation.
The standardisation of components facilitates efficient and standardised processes that in turn allows the creation of innovative products with greater complexity.
*Innovations are built on the foundations of previous innovations which have now become commonplace.*

Business operates in a world where there’s a constant flow of change, where the novel becomes commonplace and where the commonplace enables the novel.
If we define economic progress as the movement of our society to ever more complex technological marvels, then progress is simply a manifestation of this competition.
This impacts all organisations.
This is what we have to map.


== The first map

Figure 9 is what a map of a single line of business should look like.
I created my first map in 2005 and it was for an online photo service that I ran.
Take a few minutes to read it carefully.


.Basic elements of a map
[#img-fig9-Basic-elements-of-a-map]
[caption="Figure 9: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*9UXhn8Ne74Ijfn931sjOPw.jpeg]
image::1_9UXhn8Ne74Ijfn931sjOPw.jpeg[Figure 9 - Basic elements of a map,900,600,align=center]

The map is *visual* and *context specific* i.e. it is unique to that line of business containing the components that influence it *at that moment in time*.
The map has an *anchor* which is the user (in this case a public customer though other types of users exist) and their needs.
The *position* of *components* in the map are shown relative to that user on a *value chain, represented by the y-axis*.
Each component needs the component below it, however the higher up the map a component is then the more visible it becomes to the user.
The lower it is then the less visible it becomes.
For example, in that first map the user cares about online photo storage but whilst this needs the provision of underlying components such as compute and power, those components are positioned far from the user and hence are less visible.


The user cares about the service and not about who and how electricity is provided to make the service work.
Of course, as the provider of the service, I cared about everything — my users’ needs, what compute we used and even what electricity provider we employed.

The components of the map also have a stage of evolution.
This evolution is shown as the x-axis and all the components on the map are *moving* from left to right driven by supply and demand competition.
In other words, the map is not static but fluid and as components evolve they become more commodity like.
These are:-

*Genesis.* This represents the unique, the very rare, the uncertain, the constantly changing and the newly discovered.
_Our focus is on exploration_.


*Custom built*.
This represents the very uncommon and that which we are still learning about.
It is individually made and tailored for a specific environment.
It is bespoke.
It frequently changes.
It is an artisan skill.
You wouldn’t expect to see two of these that are the same.
_Our focus is on learning and our craft_.


*Product (including rental).* This represent the increasingly common, the manufactured through a repeatable process, the more defined, the better understood.
Change becomes slower here.
Whilst there exists differentiation particularly in the early stages there is increasing stability and sameness.
You will often see many of the same product.
_Our focus is on refining and improving_.


*Commodity (including utility)*.
This represents highly standardised, high volume production. By necessity the product is well defined and fit for a specific (well known and understood) purpose. The product is difficult to differentiate on anything other than price and branding.
With time we become habituated to the product, it is increasingly less visible and we often forget it’s even there.
_Our focus is on ruthless removal of deviation, on industrialisation, and operational efficiency_.


However, the map also has some advanced features which are not so immediately obvious.
There is a *flow* of risk, information and money between components.


The components can also represent different *types* of things, the military equivalent of different troops — infantry, tanks and artillery.
These types represent *activities*, *practices*, *data* and *knowledge*.
All of these types of components can move and in our case this means evolve from left to right driven by competition.
However, the terms we use to describe the separate stages of evolution are different for each type.
_In order to keep the map simple_, the x-axis of evolution shows the terms for *activities* alone.
The terms that I use today for other types of things are provided in figure 10.


.Types and stages of evolution
[#img-fig10-types-and-stages-of-evolution]
[caption="Figure 10: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*PqRZpTXh4NJF_gfMtt8tsg.jpeg]
image::1_PqRZpTXh4NJF_gfMtt8tsg.jpeg[Figure 10 - Types and stages of evolution,900,600,align=center]

IMPORTANT: This demonstrates the faceted nature of Wardley mapping. This represents the range of different dimensions within which business concepts can be expressed. Whilst it is possible that some of these are orthogonal to all the others (i.e. they have no relationship to the others and can be represented on their own unique axis), this is rarely going to be the case..... *I'm not sure if I agree with all these categories*. Data and knowledge, for example, should be symbiotic and closely aligned. I'm also not sure if the intervening concepts are useful.

Lastly *climatic* patterns can be shown on the map.
I’ve highlighted these more advanced elements onto figure 11.


.Advanced elements of a map
[#img-fig11-Advanced-elements-of-a-map]
[caption="Figure 11: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*QD633OZDJxds3MWe_cbvUA.jpeg]
image::1_QD633OZDJxds3MWe_cbvUA.jpeg[Figure 11 - Advanced elements of map,900,600,align=center]

In the above map, platform is considered to be evolving to a more utility form and inertia exists to the change.
Normally, we don’t mark up all of these basic and advanced elements in this way.
We simply accept that they are there.
However, it’s worth knowing that they exist.

We can start to discuss the landscape.
For example:

* Have we represented the user need reasonably and are we taking steps to meet that user need?
* Maybe we’re missing something such as an unmet need that we haven’t included?
* Are we treating components in the right way?
* Are we using a utility for power or are we somehow building our own power station as though it’s a core differentiator visible to the user?
** If so, why?
* Have we included all the relevant components on the map or are we missing key critical items?
* We can also start to discuss our anticipations of change.
* What happens when platform becomes more of a utility?
* How does this affect us?
* What sort of inertia will we face?


Maps are fundamentally a communication and learning tool.
Here are a few steps to help you create your own maps.

== Step 1 — Needs

You must first focus on the user need (_this is described as an anchor which orients the map. This is twaddle_).
This requires you to define the scope of what you’re looking at — are we a tea shop, an automotive company, a nation state or a specific system?
A map for a particular company is part of a wider map for the ecosystem that the company operates within.
A map of a particular system within a company is part of the map for the entire company.
You can expand and reduce as necessary.
It’s worth noting that the user needs of one map are components in another.
For example, the user needs for a company producing nuts and bolts become the components used (i.e. nuts and bolts) for a company producing automobiles or bridges.

In our first map the user needs for an electricity provider are simply drawn as a single component far down the value chain of our map and described as _power_.
As a user, we could describe our needs for power as being reliable, utility like, provided in standard forms and accessible.
From the perspective of examining an online photo service then a single component is enough.
However, that single component will break into an entire map for an electricity provider including different forms of transmission, generation and even spot markets.
A single node on one map can be an entire map from another person’s perspective.
Equally, the entire map of your business might be a single component for someone else.


Hence start with a scope and define the user needs for that scope.
A common trap is not to think of your user’s needs but instead to start to describe your own needs i.e. your desire to make a profit, to sell a product or be successful.
If you’re a tea shop then your users may have needs such as:

* a refreshing drink,
* a convenient location,
* a comfortable environment,
* a quick service and
* a tasty treat.

This in turn requires you to have the capability to satisfy those needs and distinguish between what your users want but do not necessarily need.
So start with questions such as:

* what does this thing need to do,
* how will its consumers interact with it and
* what do they expect from it?

There are various techniques to help elucidate this but I’ve found nothing more effective than talking directly to your own users.
Creating a user journey for how they interact with what you provide.
You might find they have genuine unmet needs or novel needs that they find difficult in describing.
These are important.
Don’t ignore them just because you don’t provide them at this time.
Back in 2005, our user needs for the online photo service included such things as sharing photos online with other users.
This required us to have a *capability* such as the storage of digital photos and a web site to upload and share them with others.
These capabilities are your highest level components and the manifestation of your user needs.
For us, that included the storage of digital photos, manipulation of images (removal of red-eye, cropping), sharing of images via the web site and printing to physical products from photos to mouse mats.
This is shown in figure 13.


.User needs
[#img-fig13-User-needs]
[caption="Figure 13: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*x0ovFBM_aq7DxseX0nOuRQ.jpeg]
image::1_x0ovFBM_aq7DxseX0nOuRQ.jpeg[Figure 13 - User needs,900,600,align=center]

== Step 2 — Value Chain

The value chain is the components required to provide the capability to deliver the user need.

In the case of our online photo service, once the basic user needs were known then we could describe our top level capabilities, our top level components.
We could then describe the subcomponents that these visible components themselves would need.
The best way I’ve found of doing this, from practice, is to gather a group of people familiar with the business and huddle in some room with lots of post-it notes and a huge whiteboard.
On the post-it notes write down the user needs and the top level capabilities required to meet them.
Place these on the wall in a fairly random order.
Then for each capability, using more post-it notes, the group should start to write down any subcomponents that these top-level components will use.
This can include any activity, data, practice or set of knowledge.

For each subcomponent further subcomponents should then be identified until a point is reached that the subcomponents are now outside of the scope of what you’re mapping.
Power doesn’t need to be broken down any further if the company consumes it from a utility provider.
By way of example, to manipulate online digital photos needs some sort of online digital photo storage component.
This in turn needs a web site which in turn needs a platform that in turn needs compute resources, storage resources, an operating system, network, power and so forth.
These components will become part of your value chain and any component should only be written once.
When the group is satisfied that a reasonable set of components for all the needs have been written then draw a single vertical line and mark it as the value chain as shown in figure 14.

.A framework for the value chain
[#img-fig14-A-framework-for-the-value-chain]
[caption="Figure 14: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*0EbD0NZUuo8R5HN2Im73-A.jpeg]
image::1_0EbD0NZUuo8R5HN2Im73-A.jpeg[Figure 14 - A framework for the value chain,900,600,align=center]

The top-level components (i.e. your capabilities, what you produce, what is most visible to the user) should be placed near the top of the value chain.
Subcomponents should be placed underneath with lines drawn between components to show how they are related e.g. this component needs that component.
As you go through this process, you may wish to add or discard components depending upon how relevant you feel they are to drawing a useful picture of the landscape.
They can always be added or removed later.


In figure 15, I’ve provided a value chain for our online photo service adding in the superfluous term “needs” to emphasise that this is a chain of needs.
Obviously, for simplicity, not everything is included e.g. payment.

.A value chain
[#img-fig15-A-value-chain]
[caption="Figure 15: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*MJncHbPFjIfhArv_NnzH2A.jpeg]
image::1_MJncHbPFjIfhArv_NnzH2A.jpeg[Figure 15 - A value chain,900,600,align=center]

To reiterate, things near the top are more visible and have more value to the user.
For example, online image manipulation was placed slightly higher than online photo storage because it was seen as a differentiator with other services that existed in 2005 and hence valued by users.
Online photo storage was also a subcomponent of image manipulation and was placed lower.
The web site, a necessity for sharing, was placed slightly further down because though it was essential, many websites existed and it was also a subcomponent of online photo storage.
Now this last point we could easily argue over but the purpose of doing this in a group is you’ll often get challenge and debates over what components exist and how important they are.
*This is exactly what you want to happen.*
In the same way a military commander welcomes challenge on the ground from troops on the position of forces and key features.
Don’t ignore the challenge but celebrate it as this will become key to making a better map.


But also, don’t waste time trying to make a perfect value chain in order to build a perfect map.
It’s not only impossible, it’s unnecessary.
*All maps, including geographical maps are imperfect representations of what exists. They just need to be _fit for purpose_*

== Step 3 — Map

Value chains on their own are reasonably useless for understanding strategic play in an environment.
This is because they lack any form of context on how it is changing i.e. they lack movement.
If you think back to the example of Nokia, then its value chains have radically altered over time from a paper mill to telecommunications company.
In order to understand the environment, we therefore need to capture this aspect of change and combine it with our value chain.

The largest problem with creating an understanding of the context in which something operates is that this process of change and how things evolve cannot be measured over time.
Whilst evolution cannot be measured over time, the different stages of evolution can be described.
So, this is exactly what you need to do.
Take your value chain and turn it into a map with an evolution axis.
On the wall or in whatever tool you’ve used to create your value chain, now add a horizontal line for evolution.
Mark on sections for genesis, custom built, product and commodity as shown in figure 16.

TIP: see the earlier table if you are measuring something dfferent

.Adding evolution to your value chain
[#img-fig16-Adding-evolution-to-your-value-chain]
[caption="Figure 16: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*l8ttd7KYfIdkPi8B6DRN6g.jpeg]
image::1_l8ttd7KYfIdkPi8B6DRN6g.jpeg[Figure 16 - Adding evolution to your value chain,900,600,align=center]

Start to move the components of the value chain to their relevant stage.
For each component the group should question how evolved it is?
In practice the best way to do this is to examine its characteristics and ask:

* How ubiquitous and well defined is the component?
* Do all my competitors use such a component?
* Is the component available as a product or a utility service?
* Is this something new?


Be warned, this step is often the main cause of arguments in the group.
You will regularly come across components that parts of the group feel passionate about.
They will declare it as unique despite the fact that all your competitors will have this.
There is also the danger that you will describe the component by how you treat it rather than how it should be treated.
Even today, in 2016, there are companies that custom build their own CRM (customer relationship management) system despite its near ubiquity and essential use in most industries.

There are many causes for this, some of which are due to inertia and the component being a pet project and in other cases it is because the component is actually multiple subcomponents.
In the latter case, you’ll often find that most of the subcomponents are commodity with maybe one or two that are genuinely novel.
Break it down into these subcomponents.
It is essential for you to challenge the assumptions and that is part of what mapping is all about, exposing the assumptions we make and providing a means to challenge.
This is also why working in a group matters because it’s far too easy for an individual to apply their own biases to a map.


If we think of mapping a tea shop, then we might argue that our lemon drizzle cake is home-made and therefore custom built.
But in reality, is the provision of a cake in a tea-shop something that is rare and hence relatively novel?
Or is the reality that a user expects a tea shop to provide cake and it is commonplace?
You might market the cake as home-made but don’t confuse what you market something as with what it is.
The tea shop up the road could just as easily buy mass produced cake, add some finishing flourishes to it and describe it as home-made.
If it’s cheaper, just as tasty, more consistent and to the user an expected norm for a tea shop then you’ll be at a disadvantage.
To help you in the process of challenge, I’ve added a cheat sheet in figure 17 for the characteristics of activities.
How this was created will be discussed in later chapters but for now simply use this as a guide.
Where arguments continue to rage then look to see if the component is in fact multiple subcomponents.


.The cheat sheet
[#img-fig17-the-cheat-sheet]
[caption="Figure 17: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Hr-7aM2-IW34edpBtnKWQQ.jpeg]
image::1_Hr-7aM2-IW34edpBtnKWQQ.jpeg[Figure 17 - The cheat sheet,900,600,align=center]

IMPORTANT: THIS CHEAT SHEET IS VERY IMPORTANT

Don’t worry if some of the terms are confusing in the cheat sheet, just use what you can.
Like Chess, mapping is a craft and you will get better with practice.

You can’t outsource mapping to someone else.
Well, technically you can but you won’t be learning and you’ll just become dependent upon them, constantly asking for your next move.
Which, to be honest, is what many of us have done.
The amount of value that you will get from mapping increases with the amount of work you put into repeatedly using it.

It’s also worth noting that when adding practices, data and knowledge to your map then you can use the same cheat sheet for each stage of evolution i.e. data that is *modelled* (see figure 10) should be widespread, commonly understood, essential and believed to be well defined.
*It shares the same characteristics as commodity activities.*
Once you have placed the components in their relevant stage to the best of your ability, you now have a map, as per figure 18.
Remember that this map was for an online photo service in 2005.
We expect a lot more from an online photo service today.
The map is hence fluid and constantly evolving.


.The map
[#img-fig18-the-map]
[caption="Figure 18: ",link=https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*lfbIXuSF0KAlPcti3GFY5w.jpeg]
image::1_lfbIXuSF0KAlPcti3GFY5w.jpeg[Figure 18 - The map,900,600,align=center]

The next thing to do is to share your map with others and allow them to challenge it.
This process of sharing not only refines the map but spreads ownership.
